Title : Loan Prediction

Introduction:
In today’s world, taking loans from financial institutions has become a very common phenomenon. Everyday a large number of people make application for loans, for a variety of purposes. But all these applicants are not reliable and everyone cannot be approved. Every year, we read about a number of cases where people do not repay bulk of the loan amount to the banks due to which they suffers huge losses. The risk associated with making a decision on loan approval is immense.
